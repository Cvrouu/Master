  <p>Hello,</p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I am submitting this bug bounty report regarding a security vulnerability I discovered in a bug bounty program. I wish to inform you of this vulnerability to complete my BugBountyJourney. üêû
  </p>
  <h2>Description of the Vulnerability</h2>
  <p>
    I have discovered a "File Information Disclosure" vulnerability in a web application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive information, such as the contents of system or configuration files, which should not be publicly accessible. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> I rate the severity of this vulnerability as medium due to its ability to disclose sensitive and potentially confidential information. An attacker could use this information to carry out further targeted attacks or compromise system security. ‚ö†Ô∏è
