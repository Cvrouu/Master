  <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Page!</h1>
  <p>Hey there! I'm Gihad BOUGUERBA, based in Paris (FR), and I'm passionate about cybersecurity and network administration. I love delving into vulnerabilities and crafting robust solutions to keep systems secure. ðŸ’»ðŸ”’</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>After spending time chatting and digging around the web, I've developed quite a knack for cybersecurity. I'm pretty handy with network and systems administration. Setting up complex networks and securing operating systems is my jam. Plus, I'm quite adept at spotting security vulnerabilities. Through tinkering around, I've even delved into niche topics like cyber attacks and web app security. And all of this, while having a blast! ðŸ”§

On HTB, I've cut my teeth on all sorts of machines, from the easy ones to the tough nuts. Solving puzzles and exploiting security flaws, that's my thing. And with PortSwigger, I've discovered the fascinating world of web attacks. From manipulating HTTP requests to uncovering vulnerabilities, I've learned a ton about web application security. That's how I've built up a solid cybersecurity experience, and I intend to keep improving myself more and more! ðŸ’»ðŸš€</p>
